# Lirah-1 (NTS-1 mkII)

> Drumlogue project docs: see `drumlogue-lirah-1/README.md`.

`Lirah-1` is a Lyra-8 inspired oscillator for the Korg NTS-1 mkII (`osc` module).

This project is based on the original Lyre-1 project by James D. Cheetham:
https://github.com/jamesdcheetham/Lyre-1

Lyra-8 from SOMA Laboratory https://somasynths.com/

Ported to NTS-1 mkII by Daniel Majid Mirzakhani.

## Highlights

- Sine-core voice with FM, wave folding, and feedback.
- Hyper LFO behavior from two internal LFOs that are AND-gated.
- Extra assignable modulation source (`LFO 3`) with selectable target and rate.
- Playable range tuning for both modulator pitch and carrier pitch.

## Controls

- `Knob A (FM DEPTH)`: FM amount from the modulator into the carrier.
- `Knob B (HYPER LFO)`: Depth of the Hyper LFO pitch jump.
- `LFO1 RATE`: Rate of Hyper LFO lane 1.
- `LFO2 RATE`: Rate of Hyper LFO lane 2.
- `FOLD`: Amount of wave folding.
- `FM TUNE`: Relative tuning of the modulator (up to one octave).
- `PITCH`: Relative tuning of the carrier (up to one octave).
- `FEEDBACK`: Feedback amount in the carrier path.
- `LFO3 TARGET`: Chooses what `LFO 3` modulates.
- `LFO3 RATE`: Rate of `LFO 3` with slow-focus scaling (`0-50%` = `0-1 Hz`, `50-100%` = `1-25 Hz`).
